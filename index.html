       <p>I am a former IT recruiter who has made the switch into becoming a Data Analyst and Software Engineer focused in Python. I plan on focusing on building my SQL skills as well as continuing to play with all the other tools I have a solid foundation with. This is a website I have built using HTML and Bootstrap for the styling. Below, you will find a few of the projects that I have done both for class and for fun. Enjoy and please consider me for any of your data needs. </p>
